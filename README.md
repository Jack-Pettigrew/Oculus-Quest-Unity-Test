# Oculus Quest Unity Test
 A repository dedicated to learning Oculus Quest development. As of writing, the Quest is a device which currently lacks a wide variety of games/apps specifically due to its recent release and specific hardware
 requirements - a variable that some PCVR games can not afford to rework their design for. 
 
 The Quest is unique in its cordless 'freedom of movement' design, allowing for the creation of innovative games and apps similar to that of [Tea For God](https://void-room.itch.io/tea-for-god).
 
 Techniques being learnt include but not limited to:
 - Lighting techniques
 - Geometry and LOD optimisation
 - Occlusion mapping
 - Guardian Boundary as game mechanic
 - VR enhanced game mechanics - such as Holstering or Player involved crafting.
 
 The various Scenes in this project lead from a central Scene - a Dev Hub - each representing a separate testing space for a chosen development area. 
 
 Current Scenes in use:
 - Dev Hub
 - Matrix Room Test
 - Oculus Boundary Test
 - VR Stealth Mechanics Test
 
 #### Dev Hub
 A central hub area used as a between Scene area. 
 
 #### Matrix Room Test
 A 'Matrix Gun Hallway' inspired Scene designed to understand best practices and comfortability in VR. Preventing VR induced sickness in players who are sensitive to VR movement.
 
 #### Oculus Boundary Test
 An area to test the retrieval of the room-scale Guardian boundary and apply it as a game mechanic.
 
 #### VR Stealth Mechanics Test
 A Scene dedicated to developing and testing a VR stealth system, gunplay, and other suitable VR enhanced mechanics.
 
 *This is primarily the basis of a entirely seperate project and may possibly be migrated as such.*
